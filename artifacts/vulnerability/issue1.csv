endpoint,6.70,cve-2021-21390,"minio is an open-source high performance object storage service and it is api compatible with amazon s3 cloud storage service. in minio before version release.2021-03-17t02-33-02z, there is a vulnerability which enables mitm modification of request bodies that are meant to have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. in a put request using aws-chunked encoding, minio ordinarily verifies signatures at the end of a chunk. this check can be skipped if the client sends a false chunk size that is much greater than the actual data sent: the server accepts and completes the request without ever reaching the end of the chunk + thereby without ever checking the chunk signature. this is fixed in version release.2021-03-17t02-33-02z. as a workaround one can avoid using ""aws-chunked"" encoding-based chunk signature upload requests instead use tls. minio sdks automatically disable chunked encoding signature when the server endpoint is configured with tls."

docker,18.09.0,cve-2021-29475,"hedgedoc (formerly known as codimd) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. an attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to pdf. since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. this will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. this issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. starting the codimd/hedgedoc instance with `cmd_allow_pdf_export=false` or set `""allowpdfexport"": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. this exploit works because while phantomjs doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the pdf file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through javascript rendering. the impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the codimd/hedgedoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. even though the suggested docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe oauth secrets among other things."
